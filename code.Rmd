## Introduction

We conducted a two-stage multi-treatment or network meta-analysis for the simultaneous analysis of all treatments of interest and which co-occur in the same trial. This approach allows direct comparisons of treatments with each other, and takes into account all the correlations (see Madden et al. 2016 for more details). 

The most common form of effect size used in traditional meta-analysis are based on the contrasts of the treatment of interest with a common reference (e.g. control treatment), such as mean difference, response ratio, etc. This is known as the conditional modeling approach, also named contrast-based meta-analysis. An alternative and simpler approach, which is commonly used in plant pathology, is to fit a two-way linear mixed model directly to the treatment means. This is know as the unconditional modeling approach or arm-based meta-analysis. 


## Import data

Let's first import the data and load the packages needed for the analyses.

```{r}
library(readr)
fhb_sev <- read_csv("data/fhb_sev.csv")
fhb_yield <- read_csv("data/fhb_yield.csv")
```
